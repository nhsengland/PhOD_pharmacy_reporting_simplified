### Note on data collection and completeness

<font size="2">

Data is collected from regional and sub-regional teams on a monthly basis. Not all of this data comes through to us at NHS England at the same time and therefore at various points in the month data from certain areas may be missing. It will be made obvious in the report if any data is known to be missing. 

In some case, regions or sub-regions may send in updated data for previous months which is usually due to late declaration of unplanned closures by contractors. Therefore, historic data may be amended month on month if any updated data is sent in.

The regional and sub-regional areas that send in data are as follows:
Full regions:
* East of England
* London
* South East 
* South West

Sub regions:
* East Midlands
* West Midlands
* North East and North Cumbria
* Humber and North Yorkshire
* South Yorkshire
* West Yorkshire
* Cheshire and Merseyside
* Greater Manchester
* Lancashire and South Cumbria

N.B. DAC contracts have been excluded from any analysis in this pack.
